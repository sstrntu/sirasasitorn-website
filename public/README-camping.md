# Camping.glb Model

Please place your `camping.glb` 3D model file in this `/public` directory.

The 3D scene expects the file to be located at:
- `/public/camping.glb`

## Model Requirements:
- Format: GLB (preferred) or GLTF
- Recommended size: < 10MB for good loading performance
- Should contain interactive objects that users can click on
- Consider adding materials that respond well to lighting

## Fallback:
If no camping.glb is found, the scene will show a loading screen.
For testing purposes, you can use any GLB model and rename it to `camping.glb`.

## Free 3D Models:
- Sketchfab (many free models)
- Poly Haven
- Mixamo (for characters)
- Google Poly (archived but accessible)
